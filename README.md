# Breast Cancer Classification - Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Comparison

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and model performance comparison on a **Breast Cancer Classification dataset**. We analyze the dataset, visualize patterns, and evaluate multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing classifier.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We begin by exploring the dataset to understand feature distributions, correlations, and patterns.

### 📊 Plots Generated:
-   **Distribution of Diagnosis** (Benign vs. Malignant)
-   **Feature Histograms** to visualize value distributions
-   **Correlation Heatmap** to identify feature relationships
-   **Box Plots** for key features
-   **Pair Plot** to analyze feature interactions

---

## 🚀 Machine Learning Models Used
We trained multiple classification models to predict breast cancer diagnosis:

1️⃣  **Random Forest**
2️⃣  **Naïve Bayes**
3️⃣  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
4️⃣  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5️⃣  **Logistic Regression**
6️⃣  **Decision Tree**

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 📌 Model Explanations

* **Random Forest:** Ensemble of decision trees, reduces overfitting.
* **Naïve Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier, assumes feature independence.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies based on the majority class of neighbors.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
* **Logistic Regression:** Predicts the probability of a binary outcome.
* **Decision Tree:** Tree-like structure of decisions to classify instances.
